You practice because you really want to win the national finals game badly. While doing dribble drills, you slip on sweat and rolled your ankle. This injury isn't life threatning but it was on the night of the game. Do you either play your full amount of minutes and ignore the pain in your ankle or limit your minutes and what you do on the court.
